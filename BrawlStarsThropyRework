Part 1: thropy rework + reset------------------------------------------
There are now 50 tiers in total! the top tier is called max!
to reach max tier with a brawler you need 1000 thropies
*in the new system, each tier is 20 thropies (tier 20 = 25, tier 25 = 37, tier 30 = MAX tier)
thropy gain and loss will be adjusted to fit with the new system and become more forgiving under 30 thropies
thropy season starts and ends at the same time as bp
*youll only start losing more thropies than you win AFTER 1100 thropies (W for people in rank 25-30)
*new monthly thropy reset resets only ABOVE 1000 and not 500, it resets to 1000 tho (rank 31-35 dosent exist anymore basiclly)
*Extra thropies above 1000 become SEASONAL THROPIES and progress towards the new THROPY BOX (mostly cosmetics and gems, no progression really)
The thropy box has 5 different levels that give from a minimum of 6-20 rewards, include a gurranteed rare-epic skin based on the reward and can drop mythic, legendary, and hyperchrage skin if you reach the max box with 3000 EXTRA THROPIES above 1000 which is pretty insane ngl
tier upgrade rewards got removed (no more 10 bling per 1000 thropies so sad)
the new higher level boxes will be EXTREMLY GRINDY but itll still be more than like 5 bling you get normally
*the pop up for seasonal thropies will kinda look like fame basiclly but thropies instead of credits, and as i said youll get the seasonal thropies above 1000 which have the colors of bling ill send an image soon
matchmaking will consider brawler thropies more before 1000 (goated)
after 1000 thropies all players will be in the same matchmaking pool (rank 30-35 same lobby, easier on matchmaking times)
*as previously stated youll only lose more thropies than you gain after 1100+ (25-30 will lose much less thropies so thats good)
underdog is removed after 1000 (i mean it dosent really matter)
*win streaks tied to individual brawlers (no more keeping a low thropy brawler for streaks)
part 2: leadersboards----------------------------------------------------
*seasonal leaderboard per brawler that resets every season, and a all time leaderboard that tracks the HIGHEST AND NOT CURRENT thropy count and dosent reset
*for each time you enter the seasonal leaderboard, you get PRESTIGE (this is fucking insane ngl i didnt expect them to add prestige), and you get one prestige for each time you get into the leaderboard with atleast one brawler , once per season
*PREVIOUS ACHIVMENTS:
do you think your rank 35 is gone now? your achivments will live forever with a unique pin if you got a rank 35 before the update
if you got 10 RANK 35s before the new update youll get an EXCLSUSIVE player title
total number of rank 35s you got will be marked on your profile forever (new badge)
in the first reset after the update EVERY BRAWLER ABOVE 1000 WILL RESET TO 1000
*the changes will be happening on the update near the end of october, if you have a brawler over 1000 youll be able to progress towards your first box right after november 7 when the season ends
AND MOST IMPORTANT,smaller dtails and values are not final and may change before the update releases!
Part 3: Extras------------------------------------------------------------
Seasonal thropies will have a differnet apperance, season box upgrades will have a user interface similar to that of fame/credits, the whole thing has the colorfull color pattern of bling
Prestige will also use the same color scheme, and will appear under your thropies, Max win streak on a brawler will have the brawler icon next to it!
